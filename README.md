# Unity Visual Novel Framework

## What is this project?
This is a visual novel framework for the Unity Engine. It allows you to write dialogue, character actions, scenery changes, visual effects, and many other elements into a story.

## How does it work?
It uses a custom scripting language called "VNF" that is easy to learn and designed with simplicity in mind, much like writing a screenplay.

## Where can I find the documentation?
Complete documentation is not yet available. However, you can find a list of the most useful commands in the "Assets/External" folder, under a file called "VNF Documentation.odt".

Additionally, you can use the example scripts provided as a reference since the language itself follows easily replicable patterns.
