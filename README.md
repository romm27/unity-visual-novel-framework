# Unity Visual Novel Framework

## Notice
All graphics included in the example script were generated by AI, as were the character voices. If the original voice actor wishes to have their generated audio clips removed, please contact me, and I will ensure that it will be done.
The music featured in the example was created by [Peritune.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgrQkWWf_48rQm-x-dQ4_uA)

>This project is still under active development, so even if it's stable, some features may not be complete.


## What is this project?
This is a visual novel framework for the Unity Engine. It allows you to write dialogue, character actions, scenery changes, visual effects, and many other elements into a story.

## How does it work?
It uses a custom scripting language called "VNF" that is easy to learn and designed with character actions in mind, much like writing a screenplay.

## Where can I find the documentation?
Complete documentation is not yet available. However, you can find a list of the most useful commands in the "Assets/External" folder, under a file called "VNF Documentation.odt".

Additionally, you can use the example scripts provided as a reference since the language itself follows easily replicable patterns.

You can find the example arc file inside "Assets/Data/Arcs/example_arc".
And another simpler example file inside "Assets/Data/Arcs/effect_demo"

## Scripting
In the "External" folder, you'll find a file named "VNP.xml." This file defines the scripting language, enabling proper syntax highlighting in Notepad++. While it's not required, it significantly enhances the writing experience.

## Assets

This project uses various **ScriptableObjects** to store data related to the story, such as **Arcs** and **Characters**. All of these can be created by right-clicking in the Unity Editor and hovering over: ``` Create/VN ```

To ensure the desired assets are available, you MUST reference them in the appropriate field within the Arc ScriptableObject.

### Asset Folders:

- **Character ScriptableObjects and Poses**:  
  `Data/Characters`

- **Backgrounds**:  
  `Data/Backgrounds`

- **Audio Files**:  
  `Data/Audio`

- **Scripts, Voice lines and related ScriptableObjects**:  
  `Data/Arcs`

The entry point to the story will be the first Arc file in the Arcs array from the Director GameObject present in the scene.

## Important!

> Note: Currently, there is an issue where even Arcs without dialogue must have an empty **Scene Voices** entry that matches the Arc index in order for the VNP scripts to compile correctly.

## Notes

> Note: Creating ScriptableObjects for Backgrounds is not strictly required at this time.
